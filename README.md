# 🩺 Pneumonia Detection Using Deep Learning

An end-to-end Deep Learning–based web application for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using CNN transfer learning with **VGG19**.  
The trained model is deployed as a **Flask web application** using **Docker** on **Hugging Face Spaces (Free CPU tier)**, enabling real-time predictions with confidence scores.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete **machine learning lifecycle**:

**Dataset → Preprocessing → CNN Training → Evaluation → Model Saving → Deployment → Inference**

A convolutional neural network based on **VGG19 (ImageNet pretrained)** is trained on chest X-ray images to classify scans into:

- **NORMAL**
- **PNEUMONIA**

The trained model is integrated into a Flask-based web application where users can upload an X-ray image and instantly view predictions along with confidence scores.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle – Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
- **Classes**: NORMAL, PNEUMONIA
- **Image Type**: Grayscale chest X-rays (converted to RGB)

### Dataset Split

| Split      | Normal | Pneumonia | Total |
|------------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Train      | 1,341  | 3,875     | 5,216 |
| Validation | 8      | 8         | 16    |
| Test       | 234    | 390       | 624   |

> **Note**: Due to the small validation set, final performance is primarily evaluated on the test set.

## 🔄 Data Preprocessing

- Resize images to **128 × 128**
- Convert grayscale images to 3-channel RGB
- Normalize pixel values to [0, 1]
- Apply data augmentation (rotation, shift, zoom, horizontal flip)

These steps help improve generalization and reduce overfitting.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- **Base Model**: VGG19 (ImageNet pretrained, top layers removed)
- **Custom Classification Head**:
  - Flatten
  - Dense (512, ReLU) + Dropout
  - Dense (128, ReLU)
  - Dense (2, Softmax)

### Training Strategy

**Phase 1 – Transfer Learning**
- VGG19 layers frozen
- Classifier layers trained
- Adam optimizer (lr = 1e-4)

**Phase 2 – Fine-Tuning**
- Upper VGG19 layers unfrozen
- Lower learning rate (1e-5)
- Early stopping and learning-rate scheduling applied

---

## 📈 Model Performance (Test Set)

- **Final Test Accuracy**: 91.67%
- **Final Test Loss**: 0.2557

### Key Observations

- **Pneumonia Recall**: ~95%
- Reduced false negatives after fine-tuning
- Balanced trade-off between sensitivity and specificity
